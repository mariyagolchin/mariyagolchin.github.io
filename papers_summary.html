Check Point: Enformer
- The first to employ the CNN + Transformer hybrid architecture for gene expression level and epigenetic feature prediction.

Achievements:
- Used the same dataset as Basenji247 (an updated version of Basenji).
- Achieved remarkably higher accuracy than its predecessors.

Training Approach:
- Trained by alternately feeding in human and mouse genomic sequences.
- Enabled to perform cross-species inference.

        <h1>To Transformers and Beyond: Large Language Models for the Genome</h1>
        <img src="your_image_url.jpg" alt="Your Image" width="100">
        <p>ABSTRACT
In the rapidly evolving landscape of genomics, deep learning has emerged as a useful tool for tackling complex computational
challenges. This review focuses on the transformative role of Large Language Models (LLMs), which are mostly based on the
transformer architecture, in genomics. Building on the foundation of traditional convolutional neural networks and recurrent
neural networks, we explore both the strengths and limitations of transformers and other LLMs for genomics. Additionally, we
contemplate the future of genomic modeling beyond the transformer architecture based on current trends in research. The
paper aims to serve as a guide for computational biologists and computer scientists interested in LLMs for genomic data. We
hope the paper can also serve as an educational introduction and discussion for biologists to a fundamental shift in how we will
be analyzing genomic data in the future</p>
